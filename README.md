# Neovim Personal Development Environment (PDE)

This is my personal Neovim setup. I put this together after going through the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ video series. I highly recommend going
through at least the first few videos of this playlist before diving into Neovim as an IDE. 

My setup includes a few additional plugins and themes.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/ezeev/nvim-pde.git ~/.config/nvim
```
